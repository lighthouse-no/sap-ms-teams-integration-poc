# Initial Setup

1. Install Visual Studio Code
2. In VSCode, install the Teams Toolkit plugin in and connect to your Teams installation using your admin account
3. Ensure Sideloading for Teams Apps is enabled

   From your Teams Admin Centre, select "Teams apps" --> "Setup policies"

   ![Teams Setup Policies](../img/teams_setup_policies.png)

   Select the "Global (Org-wide default)" policy and switch on "Upload custom apps"

   ![Upload custom apps](../img/upload_custom_apps.png)

   Without this setting switched on, you will not be able to test your Teams app without first making it available to your entire organisation.

   In MS Teams, click on <img src="../img/icon_apps.png" /> at the bottom of the toolbar on the left, then select <img src="../img/icon_manage_your_apps.png" /> at the bottom of the screen and then <img src="../img/icon_upload_an_app.png" />

   If sideloading has been enable, you will see this option ![Upload customised app](../img/upload_customised_app.png)
